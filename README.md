This game is a bomberman-lite clone made with the WebGL game framework [Babylon.js](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js).
Play with one to three friend, on the same computer, with a keyboard or gamepads !

Choose one of the 4 characters : Jacky, Gary, Bobby or Kenny, and make good use of the bonus you will find in the dojo : 
* Dynamite will make your bombs bigger
* Geta will make you faster
